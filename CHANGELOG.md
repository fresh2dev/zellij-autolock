All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 0.2.0 - 2024-11-07

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com///compare/0.1.1...0.2.0

This release features a major rewrite given the recently release Zellij v0.41 and its enhancements to the native Zellij Rust API.

Previously, this plugin relied on system calls to inspect the command running with a pane. This was relatively slow and less reliable than the new approach offered by the Zellij API that is significantly more performant and reliable. The speed of this new approach allows for a refined implementation offers a better user experience and is easier to maintain.

### :clap: Features

- *Breaking* - Require Zellij >= 0.41 and rewrite
- *Breaking* - remove obsolete config options `watch_triggers` and `watch_interval`
- define new config options `reaction_seconds` and `print_to_log`

To upgrade:

- [ ] Review the revised README
- [ ] Install Zellij >= v0.41
- [ ] Move any items defined in obsolete config option `watch_triggers` to the `triggers` setting.
- [ ] Add the following to your Zellij `config.kdl`

```
load_plugins {
    autolock
}
```
